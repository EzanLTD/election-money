<h1>About Election Money</h1>
<p>Interested in money in <strong>Illinois</strong> politics? This site makes available bulk downloads of Illinois campaign contributions and expenditures from the <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov'>Illinois State Board of Elections</a> going back to 1994.</p>

<p><strong>Who has to report campaign finance?</strong> Any political committee that exceeds $5,000 in either receipts or expenditures over the period of a year (this is the filing threshold). Once a committee exceeds the filing threshold, they are covered by the <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/CampaignDisclosure/PDF/CampDiscAct.pdf'>IL Campaign Disclosure Act</a> (PDF) and are required to report contributions and expenditures accordingly. This campaign finance information is, in turn, made publicly available on <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov'>elections.il.gov</a> via a search interface.</p>

<p>We built <strong>Election Money</strong> to give journalists, activists and citizens better access to and documentation for this historical data.</p>

<h3 id='data-quality'>Data quality</h3>
<p>We make available all raw candidate, committee and contribution data from the <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov/'>Illinois State Board of Elections</a>. However, prior to July 1999, when electronic filing was introduced, much of the data is incorrect or missing. <br />Keep this in mind when working with it.</p>
